* Use
 - In any shell within Emacs, run *M-x* /sticky-shell-mode/ to enable the mode locally.
 - To enable the mode for all shell buffers, run *M-x* /sticky-shell-global-mode/.

The mode should work in any shell that inherits: `eshell-mode', `comint-mode', `vterm-mode', `term-mode'. It should be easy to add support for additional modes (see `sticky-shell-supported-modes').
Most language-interpreters I could try (Python, Clojure, Lisp) derive from `comint-mode'. If you'd like to add better support for any additional modes, please let me know.

If you find a shell for which the mode doesn't work, please let me know.

* Install
The package is available through MELPA. To install from there:
  - Make sure MELPA is in your package archives
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (require 'package)
      (add-to-list 'package-archives
                   '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
    #+end_src
  - then:
** interactively
    - M-x /package-refresh-contents/
    - M-x /package-install/ sticky-shell
** with use-package
You can install and configure with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]:
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package sticky-shell
        :ensure t ; install
        ;; add your customization here
        )
     #+end_src
* Customize
The customizable variable is `sticky-shell-get-prompt'
 - `sticky-shell-get-prompt' is the function determining which prompt to show: the available options are
   - `sticky-shell-latest-prompt'
   - `sticky-shell-prompt-above-visible'
   - `sticky-shell-prompt-above-cursor'
   (see the functions' doc strings for a detailed explanation).

   You can also write your own function and assign it to this variable.

* Shorten header
Some times, a prompt is too long to fit within a one-line header. For these cases, `sticky-shell-shorten-header-mode' can be used to shorten the prompt, ensuring that the beginning and end of the prompt are always visible within the header (see [[#shorten-header-1][fourth screenshot]]).

This mode can be enabled or disabled with the usual mechanism (calling the `sticky-shell-shorten-header-mode' function).

If you wish for the header to be shortened by default, add `sticky-shell-shorten-header-set-mode' to the `sticky-shell-mode-hook'. This function ensures that `sticky-shell-shorten-header-mode' is enabled/disabled together with `sticky-shell-mode'.

** support for terminal modes
Note that `sticky-shell-shorten-header-mode' doesn't work properly in `term-mode' and `vterm-mode'.

This is not because of an issue with `sticky-shell-shorten-header-mode' itself, but because `sticky-shell-mode' uses `(thing-at-point 'line)' to read a prompt: in terminal modes, this function returns a line within the borders of a window rather than up to the first newline character. The result is that the header will always be cut-off at the window-border.

Right now I'd rather keep this general implementation simple rather than over-fit for these particular modes.

You can always define your own `sticky-shell-get-prompt' function that works as desired: if this function returns a string that doesn't fit fully within one line, `sticky-shell-shorten-header-mode' would work as usual.
