;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a minor mode that creates a header in a shell buffer.
;; The header shows a previous prompt according to the customizable value of
;; `sticky-shell-get-prompt'.
;;
;; This is most useful when working with many lines of output:
;; you can ensure that the command corresponding to the top output-line
;; is always visible by setting `sticky-shell-get-prompt' to
;; `sticky-shell-prompt-above-visible' (its default value).
;;
;; To enable the mode, run `sticky-shell-mode' in any shell buffer.
;;
;; The mode can be set globally (for all shell buffers)
;; with `sticky-shell-global-mode'.
